# Amazon-Reviews
The dataset has been obtained by the following kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products This dataset is provided by Datafiniti's Product Database and it includes product information, rating and reviews for all products. I have tried to implement a sentiment analysis based on the ratings and the reviews.
